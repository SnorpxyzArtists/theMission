==============
Much of the concept behind Snorpxys has come about by chance, or conversation. The domain, 
and the organization's name ended up being what they are because of a $0.99 domain sale,
and my desire to have a name that could be spoken. Bonus points for the pronunciation 
being arguable!! As for the conversation bits... good luck with this:
