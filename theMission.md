# The Idea:
Much of the concept behind Snorpxys has come about by chance, or conversation. The domain, and the organization's name ended up being what they are because of a $0.99 domain sale, and my desire to have a name that could be spoken. Bonus points for the pronunciation being arguable!! As for the conversation bits... good luck with this, it's pretty non-sequitur:

### The Talks:

###### Casey on Fri Jun 02, 2017:
> I'd like you to also begin daily writing - don't worry about the content or quality or anything. Just write. You'll find soon that some things just write themselves. Those ones, I can publish in a Pay-what-you-want style. I'm also talking opinion pieces, intellectual musings, humor, and anything else that's made of words.

###### Josh:
> Cool, man, thank you. Yes, I will do that, for sure. :) That'd be pretty exciting to publish a book. Even if it's "self-publishing." Just to have a completed work of writing available for people. And it's similar to the DIY self-released cassettes and such. And similarly, I strolled through Target recently and looked at their books, the new releases by major publishing companies. Holy moley, what a bunch of shitty garbage.

> I used to have this collection of surrealist writing, a lot of it humorous/surrealist writing often being funny, like truth or improv etc; Woody Allen was one of the authors. That was so interesting to me.

###### Josh on Mon Jun 05:
> I guess something I've been dealing with recently, is feeling like I don't necessarily belong or "fit in" with a lot of the kind of "scene" I've become a part of around here with the kinds of stuff I'd been making and the shows I'd been playing. It just doesn't feel a whole lot like my thing anymore and I definitely still make experimental music or whatever, but it's more than that too. And I'm not really feeling like I want to play shows and do all that kind of thing. Maybe shows here and there when warranted. I don't know man, I don't know all the details of what I'm feeling, I just feel like I'm growing away from that whole scene and the nonsense going along with it, and perhaps some of the "friends" I made along the way too.

###### Casey on Sat Jun 10:
> Due to prices, the web server is at snorp.xyz. I imagine "Snorpsees". Plus, startups are pretty much expected to have names like that these days, right?

###### Josh:
> I think it's fun and has a creative strange feel to it, and loosens up the brain. And it's not overwrought or too specific etc etc. 

###### Josh on Tue Jun 13:
> I read your article about bipolar today. It was quite moving.
> I was thinking. When we publish anything of mine - the stories, the music, the story for the game, etc - I need to be able to retain all the rights, you know? The characters, the settings, the sounds/compositions, etc; all that stuff. I don't want to be blindsided by someone coming along and telling me I can't do something with one of my characters or somesuch, because at some point I inadvertently gave away the rights.

###### Casey on Wed Jun 14:
> All rights of Snorpxyz Artists will always be permanently retained by the creator, without them needing to know how to go about legal nonsense.

> I've actually wept just because communication between distant parts of the universe are made impossible by the speed limits on causality. The way time feels like falling down a hole without being able to cling to the side and stop the future from eating the past while I just sit in the present unable to effect it. I want to fix something.

###### Josh:
> I'm inclined to think so too. I hold conflicting ideas about that, but I'm okay with them being conflicting, especially because I figure they are only conflicting because of limits or tendencies or biases of human nature and my own mind etc.

> I don't see this being relevant any time particularly soon, but eventually I'd like to have sources/connections/resources for making nice, high quality packaging for cassettes and CDs. Look into the kind of packaging Constellation Records does. I love everything about Constellation Records. 

> Also a cartographer ... eventually I will need the help of a cartographer.

###### Casey on Thu Jun 15:
> I actually have those connections, aside from the cartographer.

###### Josh:
> Good. Well eventually I will want to make some tapes and CDs, and maybe vinyl, probably all limited edition stuff, but still for a while I'm gonna keep everything digital. Until perhaps there's some demand/interest in something physical.

###### Casey:
> How about this model: A Pay-what-you-want distribution model, with a checkbox to commit to a purchase with a physical release. Get enough to make it viable, it happens. There'd be a confirmed customer base, we'd know it'd work out financially, and people who want it would get their friends to do it too.

###### Josh:
> I like that, although I wouldn't want people paying ahead or anything like that, you know what I mean? Pre-ordering something that might not even exist. Like Kickstarter

###### Casey:
> No preorders, just the honor system up to actual production, then they receive an email requesting a payment that doesn't go to us until they get the product. And with some economies of scale the price could even drop as the projected customer base rises.

> Because we don't/can't profit, the price needs to cover the board's pay, the artists considerably larger pay, and basic operations expenses. The rest can be taken back out of the cost. So it's very possible that we'd actually end up crediting some of the prices back pretty often, while the artist makes what they should make in order to comfortably keep going

###### Josh:
>I think I like the way it's structured. I'm pretty sure I do. It's going to take some time and landmarks and accomplishments and etc before I fully understand it, like truly grasp it, just with the way my mind seems to work.

###### Casey:
> The one positive thing about a republican controlled government that cuts important programs, is that the People sometimes do pick up the slack. Annnnd that's about it.

> Look into Scott Cawthon. You'll be inspired and reassured that you can go ahead abd be as reclusive as you need to if you're doing awesome stuff.

###### Josh on Fri Jun 16:
> I actually gave Creawriter five euros, which was 5.79 dollars. Totally not important but it's come to my mind several times nonetheless.

###### Josh on Sat June 17:
> I rage-quit Facebook. I was being surrounded with all this awful energy and it was infecting me. I really believe in that idea that a person is a mix of the five or so people they spend the most time with. (Not entirely but just that it has a major impact.) And so I was getting a lot of that influence from people in my Facebook feed and that was no good. Seems I'm in this stage of my overall recovery or my growth as a person where I'm shedding/growing apart from a lot of folks I used to be tight with. And the way the cultural landscape has changed so much seems to have expedited some of it.
