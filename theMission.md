The Idea
==============
Much of the concept behind Snorpxys has come about by chance, or conversation. The domain, 
and the organization's name ended up being what they are because of a $0.99 domain sale,
and my desire to have a name that could be spoken. Bonus points for the pronunciation 
being arguable!! As for the conversation bits... good luck with this, it's pretty non-sequitur:

`I actually have those connections, aside from the cartographer.`

`Good. Well eventually I will want to make some tapes and CDs, and maybe vinyl, probably all limited edition stuff, but still for a while I'm gonna keep everything digital. Until perhaps there's some demand/interest in something physical.`
* C *
`How about this model: A Pay-what-you-want distribution model, with a checkbox to commit to a purchase with a physical release. Get enough to make it viable, it happens. There'd be a confirmed customer base, we'd know it'd work out financially, and people who want it would get their friends to do it too.`
* J *
`I like that, although I wouldn't want people paying ahead or anything like that, you know what I mean? Pre-ordering something that might not even exist. Like Kickstarter.`
