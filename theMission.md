## The Need ##

Much of the concept behind Snorpxys has come about by chance, or conversation. The domain, 
and the organization's name ended up being what they are because of a $0.99 domain sale,
and my desire to have a name that could be spoken. Bonus points for the pronunciation 
being arguable!! As for the conversation bits... good luck with this:

I'd like you to also begin daily writing - don't worry about the content or 
quality or anything. Just write.
You'll find soon that some things just write themselves. Those ones, I can
publish in a Pay-what-you-want style.
